Ask each other questions: “What made you happy today?” 👂 “What was difficult today?” 👂 “How can I help you?” 👂

For this to help, your teen needs to feel safe while sharing things with you. Be open to their responses. 💚 Teens tend to be more honest when they trust that what they say will not be used against them later.

Go easy on yourself if your teen does not want to share their problems with you. 💙 Often, teens are afraid to share as they are scared they will get in trouble. Getting upset with them won’t help - keep showing you love them and give them time! 🌷",Quick|Calm,10|11|12|13|14|15|16|17,
