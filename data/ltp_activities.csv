⚽ An easy way to start talking to your children is to ask them about something they are interested in. For example, you could talk about local stories, traditions, sports, favourite books, movies, friends, music, famous people or school-related topics.

👂 You may not find everything your children share to be interesting, but it’s important to show enthusiasm and an eagerness to learn. 

Paying attention to what matters to your children can make a big difference in your relationship and their happiness. ",Quick | Calm ,8,https://docs.google.com/document/d/13C1aMXQuSciBM4Y8NvSmieTmeuige6ck8YkjNYTgFgo

💡 Together, take a minute to think about all the things you did today. 

☀️ Take turns sharing one positive or fun thing that happened. This could be something small or big, like feeling good because you cleaned the house, took a pause to take some deep breaths, learnt a new dance move, or spent time with your family and friends.

❓ Ask your children to think of a new, fun skill you could learn together.

checkin_chat,Check-in Chat,"Actively checking in on one another helps to keep relationships healthy! ⭐
Ask each other questions like: “What made you happy today?” 👂 “What was difficult today?” 👂 “How can I help you?” 👂
For this to help, your children need to feel safe while sharing things with you. Be open to their responses. 💚 

Older children tend to be more honest when they trust that what they say will not be used against them later.
Be kind to yourself if your children do not want to share their problems with you. 💙 Often, children are afraid to share as they are scared they will get in trouble. Getting upset with them won’t help - keep showing you love them and give them time! 🌷",Quick | Calm,8,
